# Building Containers the Hard Way

This guide is geared towards anyone interested in learning the low-level details regarding how to build containers. This guide is \*not\* intended for those who wish to learn to build container images with high-level tools like Docker.

At the end of this guide, you should understand the internals of a container image, how to construct a container image, and how to push a container image to a Docker container registry piece-by-piece.

Becoming a super hero is a fairly straight forward process:

```
$ give me super-powers
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

```
// Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
